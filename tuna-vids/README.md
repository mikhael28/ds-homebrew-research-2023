Tuna-viDS
=========

By Chishm

Tuna-viDS is an Xvid video player for the Nintendo DS. It plays AVI files that
contain Xvid encoded video and MP3 encoded audio.

The newest release is available to download from the
[Tuna-viDS web page](https://www.chishm.com/tuna-vids/index.html).

Controls
--------

Either touch the controls on screen, or use the following buttons:
* **B**: Play/Pause
* **X**: Toggle bottom backlight
* **Left**: Increase video delay by one frame
* **Right**: Decrease video delay by one frame

Converting Videos
-----------------

Tuna-viDS plays videos with the following format:
* Video: 256px wide, up to 192px tall, up to 12fps, Xvid encoded, non-interlaced
* Audio: Stereo or mono MP3
* Container: AVI with chunk index, video must be the first stream (fourcc 00dc)

You can use [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/) to convert videos for
Tuna-viDS with this command:

```sh
ffmpeg -i <input-file> -f avi -r 10 -s 256x192 -b 192k -bt 64k \
	-vcodec mpeg4 -deinterlace \
	-acodec libmp3lame -ar 32000 -ab 96k -ac 2 tuna-vids.avi
```

This encodes the video as Xvid at 256×192px, 10fps, 192±64kbps. You can try up
to 12fps, but anything higher will slow down the decoder too much. It encodes
the audio as stereo MP3 at 32kHz, 96kbps. It muxes it into an AVI container with
the filename `tuna-vids.avi`. Feel free to experiment with bit rates, sample
rates, and frame rates. Just keep the video exactly 256px wide and no more than
192px tall.

Loader
======

Tuna-viDS will load files from the path supplied by a homebrew loader. One such
loader is
[NDS Homebrew Menu](https://github.com/devkitPro/nds-hb-menu/releases).

1. Install NDS Hombrew Menu to your flash card.
2. Copy `tuna-vids.nds` to the `nds` folder on your flash card.
3. Create a file called `avi.ext` in the `nds` folder on your flash card with
   the following contents:

   ```

4. Put converted AVI files on your flash card.
